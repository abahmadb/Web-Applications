This directory contains the source code of the project developed for **RemyTutor**, a remote teaching website.

## Prerequisites:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) -  Version Control System
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) -  Software project management and comprehension tool
- [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/)  -  Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket technologies

## Usage

Simply clone this repo with Git and compile with Maven:

	mvn clean package
	
This will generate a 'target' folder with a WAR package named education.X.X.X.war, where X.X.X is the version of the project.

The archive can then be deployed in Tomcat. To sign in on the the website, any combination email-password can be used, as long as the email is syntactically an email (like somethingâ€‹@smthng.com)
